# Profile Widgets Assignment (Vite + React + Tailwind)

This project implements the assignment UI: left half empty (responsive for laptop), and two right-side widgets:
- Tabs: About Me / Experiences / Recommended
- Gallery: add images, thumbnails, left/right arrows

## Notes
- The left column is intentionally empty to match the assignment (desktop/laptop layout).
- The gallery supports adding images from your computer. Thumbnails are stored in memory (client-side).
- Designed for laptop screens (>= 768px). It is responsive but assignment asked only for laptop responsiveness.
